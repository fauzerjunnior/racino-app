The Racino platform is a gamified dashboard designed for the players of the game. The project was developed from scratch using the React ecosystem stack.

## Technologies and tools used in the project

- React.js
- Typescript
- Styled Components
- ESLint
- Prettier
- React Icons
- React Router Dom V6

## Best practices adopted in the project

- Componentized UI and dashboard: The interface was fully modularized using reusable and isolated components, improving scalability and maintainability.

- Strong typing: All components were built with TypeScript, ensuring type safety and reducing potential bugs during development.

- Organized styling structure: Styling followed a structured and consistent pattern (e.g., CSS Modules, styled-components, or Tailwind), maintaining separation of concerns and improving readability.

- Code reusability: Core logic and UI elements were abstracted into reusable components and utility functions, reducing duplication and increasing consistency across the application.
